<h1>Owen's Javascripts Page</h1>
 
<p style="font-size:150%;">My name is Owen Madsen. This website is my portfolio of programs that I have written for the CSC106 Computer Programming course at the University of Rhode Island.<br> I designed the webpage myself using the html programming language. The Apps link above has apps I have written that run on phones.<br> The Javascripts link above has Javascripts that I have written to be embedded in web pages.
